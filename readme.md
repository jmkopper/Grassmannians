# Grassmannians.jl
A Julia language implementation of Grassmannian Chow rings and Schubert calculus. The types `GrassmannianRing` and `SchubertCycle` are introduced and implement the ring interfaces of [AbstractAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/Nemocas/AbstractAlgebra.jl). This is a work in progress.

## To do

- Reimplement Giambelli's formula by taking a (formal) polynomial determinant and then evaluating with Pieri's formula
